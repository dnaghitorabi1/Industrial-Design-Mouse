This is an example of a Solidworks plastic part assembly that uses advanced surfacing as well as one version of the master model method. The exterior body is created first, then child parts are created using the master as a reference, and the assembly is comprised of the child parts. The assembly holds the master model as an Envelope to ensure that all references are maintained.

Additional parts include simplified versions of a AAA battery pack, scroll wheel, and PCB.
